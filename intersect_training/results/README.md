# results

The `results` directory is the place to put
all output generated for a project.
This can be data along with graphs and other figures.
Where there is significant pre-processing that takes place,
typically for cleaning up the datasets prior to analysis
you may want to have a `processed` directory
clearly delineating these different steps.
