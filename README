# Intersect Training

Welcome our Intersect Training,
this is a directory setup ready to get you started
working through our training projects.
The structure of the directory is set out
following the recommendations of
[Good Enough Practices for Scientific Computing](https://github.com/swcarpentry/good-enough-practices-in-scientific-computing/blob/gh-pages/good-enough-practices-for-scientific-computing.pdf),
which takes a practical approach to the organisation of a project.
The key tips are as follows;

1. Put each project in its own directory, named after the project
2. Put text documents associated with the project in the `doc` directory
3. Put raw data in the `data` directory, and files generated through cleanup and analysis
   in the `results` directory
4. Put code for the project in the `src` directory
5. Name all files to reflect their content and function.

The structure described is a fantastic template for your own research project,
and you should make modifications to suit your project.
